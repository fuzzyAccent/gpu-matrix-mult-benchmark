# Matrix multiplication on GPU

## Introduction

This is a demo of matrix multiplication done on a GPU using [gpuJS](https://gpu.rocks) library. In it we demonstrate how fast computations can be on a GPU compared to a CPU. A matrix multiplication of two matrices A and B of square shape and the same size n provided by the user. The multplication can performed on both GPU and CPU, the retrun on the screen of the operation is the execution time of each processor.

## How to run the demo

To run this demo, you need to clone this repo by executing the following command on your terminal opened in newly created folder ex. ` cd /path/to/your/demo` then `git clone https://github.com/fuzzyAccent/gpu-matrix-mult-benchmark.git`. Or just download the [zip file](https://github.com/fuzzyAccent/gpu-matrix-mult-benchmark/archive/master.zip).

To display the fonts on this demo correctly you might need to download the [IBM Plex Web Package](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases/download/v1.0.1/Web.zip) and put it inside the project folder.
